# Bayesian Data Analysis on Premier League

This repository contains the project for the course Bayesian Data Analysis. The project assesses whether Manchester United (English Premier League football team) should re-sign Cristiano Ronaldo in the summer 2021. This assessment is done through predicting the amount of goals Ronaldo will score for ManU in a season. The project uses Python and Stan to build and run this model. 

This project is just for practice purposes and is not trying to model the real world behavior and decisions.<br>
